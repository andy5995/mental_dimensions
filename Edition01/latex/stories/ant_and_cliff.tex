\chapter{The Ant and the Cliff}

On a dry, hot day, the sun shone brightly onto the top of a cliff. An ant looking for food wandered to the cliff's edge. For several minutes, he peered down and considered jumping from it. He knew he might not survive the fall but was curious nevertheless. Finally, he decided against it and went home to his family.

The following morning, the ant remembered his urge to jump from the cliff's edge. He walked back to it and looked down for several minutes. Afterward, he went home to his family.

Every day for three years the ant returned to the cliff. He fought back the impulse to jump each time he visited the cliff's edge. And every day, he crawled back home to be with his family. During those three years, he forgot how to have fun, how to learn new activities, and how to have original ideas.

One day as the ant was standing at the cliff's edge, a hungry crow flew down and scooped him up with its mighty beak. Now, many years later, the ant's family still misses him and doesn't know where he is.
