The stories inside this book are similar to fairy tales, fables, and parables, and are suitable for children ages three to three hundred. I plan to follow this first edition of Mental Dimensions with subsequent editions that will contain additional stories, and also revisions and rewrites of previous stories. I hope this book is enjoyed by everyone. Most importantly though, I hope it's received well by my nephews and nieces.
