Mental Dimensions is a collection of child-friendly short stories and flash fiction, but can also be enjoyed by playful grown-ups. A few of these tales are plain fiction, containing no magic or mystical properties; others resemble family-friendly fairy tales, fables, or parables; some touch very lightly upon meditation concepts, others touch softly upon isolation, loneliness, and suicide; some are satirical and humorous, a little dry at times, while others may be thought-provoking; some may touch your heart, but only with a gentle kiss or a calm breeze, completely free of poison and malice.
