\chapter{Glass Prison}

Her name was Sara. She had fine, dark red hair that flowed slightly past her shoulders. Her face had been painted on by Aphrodite; she was blessed with smooth skin and a clear complexion. One look into her eyes could heal all wounds. Her smile could make someone feel like a wave of positive energy had washed over him.

Behind that bright smile was something darker. She was sad. At work, she spoke softly and moved slowly, though it was clear she cared about her customers and wanted to do the best she could. It was obvious that Sara was meant for greater things than working at the Slide-away fast food restaurant.

While waiting for his sandwich, he grabbed an orange juice. After he went to the cash register and paid, he went back to where she was standing and handed it to her. He said, “You seem like you could use a pick-me-up.” She was surprised and almost forgot to thank him. He went to eat his sandwich, left, and never saw her again. A glass wall was between them. He could see Sara's smile and look into her eyes; he could hear her soft voice and receive her positive energy; but he could never call her on the telephone, hold her hand, or brush his fingers across her cheek. He could never give his love to her, nor receive love from her. Though they were free to move around and live their lives, the glass separating them was a prison forever keeping them apart. Only light, energy, beauty, and a bottle of orange juice could pass through the glass.
