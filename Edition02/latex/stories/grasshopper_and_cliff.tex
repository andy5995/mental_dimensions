\chapter{The Grasshopper and the the Cliff}

On a dry, hot day, the sun shone brightly onto the top of a cliff. A grasshopper looking for food wandered to the cliff's edge. He peered down and considered jumping from the cliff for several minutes. The grasshopper knew he might not survive the fall but was curious nevertheless. He finally decided against it and went home to his family.

The grasshopper, however, couldn't forget the urge to jump from the cliff's edge. The next day he returned to the cliff. He looked down for several minutes. Afterward, he went home to his family.

Every day for three years the grasshopper returned to the cliff. He fought back the impulse to jump each time he visited the cliff's edge. Every day he hopped back home to be with his family. During those three years, he forgot how to have fun. He forgot how to learn new activities and how to have original ideas. He forgot many other things as well.

One day, as the grasshopper was standing at the cliff's edge, a hungry crow flew down and scooped him up with its mighty beak. Now, many years later, the grasshopper's family still misses him and doesn't know where he is.
