% TOC
% 
% This macro can be used for Table Of Contents portion of a paper
% or book. To use this macro package, put the line
%        \input toc
% at the top of your file. The following are the symbols that may be
% used with this macro:
% 
% \tocindent{ SIZE }
%        This is used to indent the table of contents
%        entries by "SIZE". "SIZE" is something like
%        `50pt', `1.0truein' or something similar.
%        (default=0pt)
% \tochead{ HEAD }
%        This is essentially the same as the definition
%        `\leftline'. The table of cantents headers are
%        not indented by `\tocindent'.
% \tocline{ SECTION }{ PAGE }
%        This is the standard table of contents line
%        containing a section and page number separated
%        with either dots or a line. This entry is in-
%        dented by `\tocindent'.
% \filldot
%        This will make the filling between the `\tocline'
%        section and page be `\dotfill'. (default)
% \filline
%        This will make the filling between the `\tocline'
%        section and page be `\hrulefil' (a solid horizon-
%        tal line).
