Edition01/Paperback/Book  8.5 x 11_ed1_v2_04 somehow got corrupted by
LibreOffice. When I reopened the file, the headers were all gone and
the page preceding the first chapter was gone (which is related to the
page headers being gone)

I was able to fix everthing, as far as I can tell so far. I deleted
...v2_04 and the fixed version ..v2_05.
