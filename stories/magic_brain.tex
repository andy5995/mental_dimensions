\chapter{The Magic Brain}

Once upon a time, in a universe far from our own, people who weren't familiar with dragons, princesses, fairies, and evil stepmothers roamed the planet Aurelius. The citizens of Aurelius never encountered cosmic beings who granted wishes, children were never relentlessly pursued by hunters dispatched by evil stepmothers, and all princesses had haircuts of a practical and appropriate length.

On a bright, comfortably warm day, an Aurelian known as Ralph sat near a mountain watching an extremely large rock. The rock was motionless upon the ground. Ralph, however, had been watching it for nearly two hours. This activity may seem quite boring to most, but Ralph had a fluffy and glittery imagination. What he saw on the rock looked to him just as what the people of Earth would see on a movie screen. He was imagining an adventure unfolding, and seeing many action scenes and characters interacting with one another.

Suddenly a fairy appeared from a gentle wind blowing nearby. Most would think it impossible, but she wasn't merely an imaginary fairy. She wasn't a fairy one might read about in false stories--she was a real fairy, with wings on her back and wearing a smart, well-woven, ankle-length dress wrapped around her pleasantly plump figure.

Ralph had never before seen a fairy, not even in his imagination. And to Ralph's good fortune, she was a good fairy.

“Hello," he said pleasantly. “My name is Ralph.”

“Greetings. My name is Genderina. I am a good fairy. Consider yourself fortunate.”

“Okay. Would you like to sit and watch this interesting rock with me?”

“No, thank you. But I would like to grant you two wishes.”

“That would be nice,” Ralph acknowledged. "Which wishes would you like to grant me?”

Laughing, Genderina replied, “I see you're not quite in tune with how this works. Whatever you would like, no matter how impossible or improbable, I will give to you.”

“Okay. I've never wished for anything before. But I would like to wish for a magic brain. I would like a brain that never makes a mistake.”

“Your wish is granted,” Genderina said, as she dramatically waved her magic wand. In that instant, all colors of a rainbow began rushing out of Ralph's ears, nose, and mouth. Anything that could cause his brain to make a mistake was leaving his body as a flood of sparkling energy.

Ralph noticed the difference immediately. His thoughts were completely changed. He thanked Genderina and asked, “How may I contact you when I would like to fill my other wish?”

“Simply call out my name three times and winds will carry your voice to me.” She then leapt upon a passing breeze and disappeared.

Ralph sat down to continue watching the extremely interesting large rock. But all he saw was a sandy brown rock. Its surface was smooth, but also contained some sharp edges. He decided the rock had no special features anymore, stood up, and departed for home.

When he arrived home, his wife and two children greeted him with happiness in their eyes and smiles on their faces.

“Hello, Cutesy. Hello, children.”

“Good evening, Father,” the children replied.

“Welcome home, Ralph.” his wife said, giving him a kiss on the cheek.

“Why kiss me on the cheek? You've kissed me there many times already.”

His wife, surprised and puzzled, replied, “I just felt like kissing you.”

He agreed it was okay for her to kiss him if she felt like it, and kissed her back.

They all sat down to eat. While they were waiting for the food to be served, the children begged, “Please tell us a story, Father!”

“All right. Give me a second to think of one.”

He tried to remember a story he heard once, but failed. He then attempted to invent one, but he was unable to do that as well.

Cutesy asked, “What's wrong, Ralph? You seem different somehow. And you always can think of stories to tell. Did something bad happen to you today?”

“Oh, no!” Ralph replied. "On the contrary; I was sitting watching my favorite rock and was approached by a good fairy named Genderina. She told me I could have two wishes. Anything I wanted. So I wished for a magic brain; and so she granted me my wish to have a brain that made no mistakes.”

The children laughed, “Father, that is a good story!”

Cutesy, however, was not amused. “Ralph, this sounds impossible, but the way you're acting I can't help but think you're telling me something true.”

“Yes, it is true.”

“Ralph, tell me a joke,” his wife commanded sternly.

Ralph attempted to think of a joke but try as hard as he might, he was unable to think of one. He was confused, “I don't understand. My brain should be working better than before. It can't make mistakes. Perhaps Genderina was really an evil fairy and lied to me.”

Cutesy cried, “Ralph, you got your wish. Don't you understand? Your brain can't make up a story or make a joke because jokes and stories are mistakes. They aren't based on cold logic and facts. Your imagination is gone! Oh no, what shall we do now? The Ralph I knew is gone.” And her tears fell like streams upon her face.

Ralph wiped away her tears with a clean napkin from the table. “You are right of course, dear, but don't worry—I still have one wish left. Genderina, Genderina, Genderina!” And with his words came the wind; whispering at first, then howling through the house. And Ralph knew it was a magical wind because it disturbed nothing and nothing was blown over. A very friendly wind it was.

Genderina appeared and said, “Ralph, have you decided on a second wish?” The children stared in amazement. Neither of them had ever before seen a fairy. But Cutesy stared with anger at this magical fairy who stole her husband's brain.

“Yes, Genderina. I've decided my brain was better before I made the first wish. Please, I wish my brain worked as it did before I met you.”

Genderina understood and granted his wish. Colors flew in from outside, through the windows and fell back into Ralph's nose, ears and mouth.

Immediately afterward, Cutesy could tell that Ralph was again himself. She forgave Genderina and invited her to dine with them. And they all lived incorrectly ever after.
